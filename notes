# index.js is the entry point created by the CLI tool
# App.js is the skeletal app created by the CLI tool
# android is a folder containing an Android project and the code required to bootstrap your application
# ios is a folder containing iOS-related code, which you wonï¿½t be touching in this tutorial.

yarn

# This creats a shim.js file which is placed in the root folder
# Create a file called "rn-cli.config.js", and add the following
// rn-cli.config.js
module.exports = {
  extraNodeModules: require('node-libs-react-native'),

# include shim.js at the root of index.js
# require rn-cli.config.js in all your files at the root
# before any include statement

# Add the following links - ReactNative links
react-native link amazon-cognito-identity-js
react-native link react-native-vector-icons
